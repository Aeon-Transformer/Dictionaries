Tortilla: A tortilla is a thin, flatbread made from wheat or corn flour, commonly used in Mexican and Spanish cuisine, and can be used as a wrap or base for various dishes. These versatile ingredients are often seasoned with ingredients like flour, salt, and spices to enhance their taste. Tortilla chips, in particular, are made by thinly slicing the dough and frying it until crispy. These snacks are widely available in supermarkets, convenience stores, and vending machines, offering a convenient and satisfying option for snacking on the go or enjoying as a snack with meals.
